### Seed Analysis

A team-based approach to provide an accuracte classification algorithm for mixed populations of dry bean seeds in central Asian countries. A comprehensive feature analysis was performed to provide the most beneficial features to be used in classification models. Multiple models were utilized for this project and accuracy was determined by determining the fiscal value of a subset from the data supplied.
