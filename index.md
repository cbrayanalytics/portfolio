### Vole Skull Classification

A statistical comparative analysis of Vole species using various morphological measurements of Vole skulls from a sample of 89 specimens. Multiple classification models were compared to predict 199 unclassified vole skulls using cross validation to determine the final accuracy.

### Seed Analysis

A team-based approach to provide an accuracte classification algorithm for mixed populations of dry bean seeds in central Asian countries. A comprehensive feature analysis was performed to provide the most beneficial features to be used in classification models. Multiple models were utilized for this project and accuracy was determined by determining the fiscal value of a subset from the data supplied.

### Auto Loan Default Prediction

The following is for a team-based approach to an auto loan default prediction algorithm. Various techniques were used for data exploration, feature extraction, and model selection. The data contained roughly 40+ features as well as incomplete data for some columns. Normalization was performed on several features and models such as XGBoost and Support Vector Machines were compared for performance by using an 80/20, Train/Test split.
